NAME

    Spreadsheet::WriteExcel - Write formatted text and numbers to a
    cross-platform Excel binary file.

======================================================================
REQUIREMENTS

    This module requires Perl 5.005 (or later)
    Parse::RecDescent
        http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Parse-RecDescent
    File::Temp
        http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=File-Temp


======================================================================
INSTALLATION

    Method 1, standard install with make
    ====================================
    Download the zipped tar file from one of the following:
        http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Spreadsheet-WriteExcel
        http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/mod_perl/cpan-search?idinfo=154
        ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/authors/id/J/JM/JMCNAMARA/

    Unzip the module as follows or use winzip:

           tar -zxvf Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-2.xx.tar.gz

    The module can be installed using the standard Perl procedure:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install    # You may need to be root
        make clean      # or make realclean

    Windows users without a working "make" can get nmake from:

        ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe


    Method 2, CPAN.pm install
    =========================
    If you have CPAN.pm configured you can install the module as
    follows:

        perl -MCPAN -e "install 'Spreadsheet::WriteExcel'"


    Method 3, ActivePerl ppm
    ========================
    ActivePerl users can use PPM as follows:

        C:\> ppm
        PPM> set repository tmp http://homepage.eircom.net/~jmcnamara/perl
        PPM> install Spreadsheet-WriteExcel
        PPM> quit
        C:\>

        If this fails try the following:

        PPM>install http://homepage.eircom.net/~jmcnamara/perl/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel.ppd

    If both of these fail you should ensure that ppm is working
    correctly. Try to install the File::Slurp module as a test:

        C:\> ppm
        PPM> install File-Test
        PPM> quit
        C:\>

    A failure here will indicate that your ppm isn't configured
    correctly or, more likely, that you are behind a firewall. Have a
    look at the "Using PPM" documentation that comes with
    ActivePerl to see how to resolve these issues.

    Method 4, ActivePerl local ppm
    ==============================
    If the previous ppm methods fail you can try a local ppm install
    as follows. Download the following two files (xx is the most
    recent version number):

        http://homepage.eircom.net/~jmcnamara/perl/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel.ppd
        http://homepage.eircom.net/~jmcnamara/perl/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-0.xx-PPM.tar.gz

    Copy them to a temp directory. There is no need to un-tar or unzip
    the PPM file.

    In the DOS shell change to the temp directory and run ppm:

         C:\> cd c:\temp
         C:\Temp> ppm

         PPM> install Spreadsheet-WriteExcel.ppd
         Install package 'Spreadsheet-WriteExcel.ppd?' (y/N): y
         Retrieving package 'Spreadsheet-WriteExcel.ppd'...
         Writing C:\perl\site\lib\auto\Spreadsheet\WriteExcel\.packlist
         PPM> quit
         Quit!

    The module should now be installed. Note, you will also have to
    install Parse::RecDescent and possibly File::Temp if it isn't
    already installed .
